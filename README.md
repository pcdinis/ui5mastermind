### Masterming Game

A game developed with UI5 libs

Instead of downloading games to play with my kid I decided to develop some simple games to play with him. This is not the state of the art on javascript language but I had a lot of fun learning about it.

### Play the game

If you want to play the game: https://www.pcdinis.com/mastermind/

- The main goal is to break the secret color code hidden by the "?".;
- Start in the lowest line and choose 4 colors (colors can be repeated);
- You can check your result in the four little icons at your right:
-- If a black check mark appears it means that you find a color and it's on the right spot;
-- If a white check mark appears it means that you find a color but it's in the wrong place;
-- The black and white marks appear in a random way that does not refer to the spot directly;
